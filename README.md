# **Boost Your TypeScript Skills** Explaining any, unknown, and never, and How TypeScript Enhances Code Quality

TypeScript has become the most loveable tool for modern developers. It helps identify errors early, keeps code organized, and makes working on bigger projects easily. But to take advantage of what TypeScript features, we need to dig into that.

In this post, I’ll break down two key areas that can make a big difference in how you write and think about your code:

- What’s the actual difference between any, unknown, and never and when should you use them?

- How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

If you've ever found yourself confused by these types or wondered what makes TypeScript such a powerful tool, you're in the right place.

## any, unknown, and never What’s the Difference?

- **any** : When a variable is declared as any, TypeScript does not do any type checks. This means the variable can be assigned any kind of value, whether it’s a string, number, object, or something else.
- **unknown** : It is a safer version of any. When a variable is declared as unknown, TypeScript requires you to check its type before performing any operation.
- **never** : It is used for values or functions that should never return a result or execute successfully.

## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

- TypeScript helps identify errors before running the code
- With clear types, TypeScript makes it easy to understand what each variable or function should be, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- By knowing consistent types, TypeScript helps to avoid misunderstandings, leading to fewer bugs

Getting the hang of TypeScript might take some time, but the improvement in your code quality and how easy it is to maintain will make it totally worth it. Whether you’re just starting out or already using it, digging deeper into TypeScript’s features will help you write better, more reliable code.
