## Explain the difference between any, unknown, and never types in TypeScript.

- **any** : When a variable is typed as any, TypeScript does not enforce any type checks. This means the variable can be assigned any kind of value, whether itâ€™s a string, number, object, or something else.
- **unknown** : It is a safer version of any. When a variable is typed as unknown, TypeScript requires you to check its type before performing any operation.
- **never** : It is used for values or functions that should never return a result or execute successfully.

## How does TypeScript help in improving code quality and project maintainability?

- TypeScript helps identify errors before running the code
- With clear types, TypeScript makes it easy to understand what each variable or function should be, making it easier to understand and maintain.
- By enforcing consistent types, TypeScript helps to avoid misunderstandings, leading to fewer bugs
